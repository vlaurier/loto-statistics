loto-statistics
===============

Under the pretext of creating my first repository: a simple application of statistics for loto &amp; euromillions.

---------------

This simple application aims to make the usage of the results easier through a PHP array.
It has been thought in that way:

- developpers can add their controller and the corresponding template.
As an example, just have a look at private/controllers/viewAllResults.php and its 
corresponding template with the SAME name: private/templates/viewAllResults.html
